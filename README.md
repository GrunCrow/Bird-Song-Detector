# Bird-Song-Detector

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/920686040.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15019122)

**Bird-Song-Detector** is part of a research to improve bird vocalization identification. The Bird Song Detector is designed to detect bird vocalizations in audio files using a YOLO-based model from the [BIRDeep project](https://github.com/GrunCrow/BIRDeep_BirdSongDetector_NeuralNetworks). The system converts audio files into spectrogram images, performs bird song detection on these images, and transforms the predictions into time segments.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The model has been trained on the [BIRDeep dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GrunCrow/BIRDeep_AudioAnnotations), which consists of audio recordings from **Do√±ana National Park (Huelva, Spain)**, located in Huelva, Spain. As such, the detector is particularly well-suited for identifying bird songs from this region and has not been tested on data from other areas.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bird-Song-Detector.git
    cd Bird-Song-Detector
    ```

2. Create and activate conda environment from environment.yml:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate bird-song-detector
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Detect Bird Songs in a Single Audio File

Run the script [predict_on_audio.py](Code/predict_on_audio.py) to detect bird songs in a single audio file:

```sh
python Code/predict_on_audio.py
```

### Detect Bird Songs in Multiple Audio Files

Run the script [predict_on_folder.py](Code/predict_on_folder.py) to detect bird songs in all audio files in a folder:

```sh
python Code/predict_on_folder.py
```

### Web Interface

For a more interactive experience, you can run the Gradio web interface ([app.py](App/app.py)) by executing the following:

```sh
python App/app.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` by default. On the main page, drag and drop your audio file into the upload box and click `Detect Bird Song` to process it.

Once the detection is complete, you will see the following:

- A list of predicted bird song segments with their start time, end time, and confidence score.
- The corresponding spectrogram image with bounding boxes indicating detected bird songs.

![Gradio Web Interface](assets/images/app_detections.png)

You can then click on the `Generate Segments` button to download a ZIP file containing the individual detected audio segments in WAV format.

![Gradio Web Interface](assets/images/app_generate_segments.png)

The generated ZIP file will contain the predictions WAV format with the name of original audio file followed by the start and end time of the detection and the confidence score.
